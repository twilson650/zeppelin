  title: "Mobile Growth Hacking: Lessons Learned from Growing from Zero to 100M Installs"
  description: "The old adage of the ‘field of dreams’ isn’t true – create a mobile app, publish it and the installs will just happen. That is no longer true anymore.

You spent all this time, effort, money and energy building an app. Why is no one downloading it? You would expect that if you build an awesome feature-rich application, it would kill it in the App Store.

Growth hacking techniques that drive installs is an art. Building a mobile application is only the first hurdle in developing a successful application. There is a lot of intricacy that goes into growth hacking and gaining not only users, but loyal users and driving real DAUs.

Come to this session and learn all the insiders growth hacking tips from Dolphin Browser."
