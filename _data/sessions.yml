  title: "Android Wear - An overview of the SDK"
  description: "Android wear extends the Android platform to a new generation of wearable devices. The user experience is designed specifically for wearables. In this session you’ll see how to use the Android Wear SDK to build a connected cloud-powered application. Using Android Studio and it’s cloud extensions, you’ll see how to build an app that ‘listens’ for changes in stock prices, and notifies a wearable device. You’ll also see how to use voice controls on the device to trigger interactions with the app, such as buying or selling the stock after a notification. Call to action: Get the SDK and start building apps today!"
